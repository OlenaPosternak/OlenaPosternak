## Hi, I'm Olena üëã

I'm a FrontEnd developer with 1 year of experience. I can collaborate effectively within a team, but I'm also equally capable of working independently when the situation demands it. Currently, I'm
interested in becoming a strong FrontEnd or even FullStack developer.
Ready for challenging tasks, interesting projects and new opportunities.
